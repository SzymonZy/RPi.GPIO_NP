If you are using armbian on NanoPi Neo/Neo2:
1. clone repository and install to your home dir

  git clone https://github.com/auto3000/RPi.GPIO_NP
  cd RPi.GPIO_NP

2. install library 

   python3 setup.py install
   or if you are using python 2.x
   python2 setup.py install

3. Test installation. Run python console and try to import RPi.GPIO
   python 
   >>> import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   
   if above command didn't throw error everything should be ok.
   If you received:
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
       ImportError: No module named 'RPi.GPIO'
       
   try:  
   >>> import RPi._GPIO
   
   If you still get error something went wrong. Try to reboot and check if import works OK.

5. Run your first python code using GPIO:

create file test.py:
   nano ./test.py

paste following code:
   #!/usr/bin/python3
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time
   led = 12
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
   GPIO.setwarnings(False)
   GPIO.setup(led,GPIO.OUT)
   i=0
   while i<10:
       print("LED on")
       GPIO.output(led,GPIO.HIGH)
       time.sleep(1)
       print("LED off")
       GPIO.output(led,GPIO.LOW)
       time.sleep(1)
       i=i+1

save file with ctrl+x and run the code:
   sudo ./test.py

please remeber /dev/mem is writeprotected under Armbian and only root can access this device. This feature prevents anyone (even those in kmem group) to access GPIO ports! Original RPi.GPIO library under raspbian use /dev/gpiomem that allow anyone access to gpio memory connected  to GPIO and forbids access to other addresses. At the moment there is no solution to freely access GPIO ports.
